Image Payloading

### üîê Image Payloading Encryption and Decryption with LSB

This project demonstrates **image payload encryption and decryption** using **Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography**, a method of concealing encrypted data within digital images. It combines **cryptography** and **steganography** to enhance data confidentiality and security.

---

### üß† Concept Overview

1. **Encryption Phase**

   * The plaintext message (payload) is first **encrypted** using a symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES or custom cipher).
   * This transforms readable text into **ciphertext**, preventing unauthorized interpretation even if extracted.

2. **Embedding Phase (LSB Steganography)**

   * The encrypted payload is then hidden within a **cover image** by modifying the **least significant bits (LSBs)** of the pixel values.
   * Because changes to LSBs cause **minimal distortion**, the visual appearance of the image remains nearly identical to the original.
   * Each bit of the encrypted message replaces the LSB of the RGB values of the image pixels in sequence.

3. **Extraction Phase**

   * During decryption, the process is reversed.
   * The program scans the stego-image pixel-by-pixel, retrieves the LSBs, and reconstructs the binary data stream.

4. **Decryption Phase**

   * The extracted binary data is **decrypted** using the same key used in encryption.
   * The original plaintext message is restored and displayed or stored securely.

### üîÑ Workflow Summary

| Stage | Operation                | Description                                                |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | **Encrypt Message**      | Convert plaintext into ciphertext using an encryption key. |
| 2     | **Embed with LSB**       | Hide the encrypted bits inside pixel LSBs of the image.    |
| 3     | **Generate Stego Image** | Output the image visually identical to the original.       |
| 4     | **Extract Payload**      | Read LSBs to reconstruct the hidden binary data.           |
| 5     | **Decrypt Message**      | Use the same key to decrypt ciphertext back to plaintext.  |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

* Supports **text-to-image encryption** and **image-to-text decryption**.
* Uses **LSB substitution** for imperceptible data hiding.
* Implements **cryptographic key-based encryption** for payload protection.
* Maintains image quality with minimal distortion (high PSNR values).

### üß© Example Use Case

* Secure message transmission through images in online communication.
* Hiding confidential data in media for digital forensics or authentication.
* Protecting sensitive files or metadata in multimedia systems.

### üîí Security Insight

While LSB steganography conceals data effectively, combining it with **encryption** significantly strengthens security. Even if the hidden data is detected, it remains unreadable without the correct decryption key ‚Äî ensuring **double-layered protection**.

==========

Platform independent Python tool to implement LSB image steganography and a basic detection technique. Features:

 - Encrypt data before insertion.
 - Embed within LSBs.
 - Extract hidden data.
 - Basic analysis of images to detect LSB steganography.

How to use:

    $ python lsb.py 
    LSB steganogprahy. Hide files within least significant bits of images.
    
    Usage:
      lsb.py hide <img_file> <payload_file> <password>
      lsb.py extract <stego_file> <out_file> <password>
      lsb.py analyse <stego_file>
    
    $ python lsb_gui.py

All data is encrypted before being embedded into a picture. Encryption is not optional. Two consequences of this are that:

 - The payload will be slightly larger.
 - The encrypted payload will have a high entropy and will be similar to random data. This is why the frequency of 0s and 1s in the LSB position should be the same ‚Äì 0.5. In many cases, real images don‚Äôt have this propriety and we‚Äôll be able to distinguish unaltered images from the ones with embedded data. More below.

Encrypt and hide an archive:

    $ python lsb.py hide samples/orig.jpg samples/secret.zip p@$5w0rD
    [*] Input image size: 640x425 pixels.
    [*] Usable payload size: 99.61 KB.
    [+] Payload size: 74.636 KB 
    [+] Encrypted payload size: 74.676 KB

Notes
-----
 
 - It is entirely possible to have images with the mean of LSBs already very close to 0.5. In this case, this method will produce false positives.
 - More elaborate theoretical methods also exist, mostly based on statistics. However, false positives and false negatives cannot be completely eliminated.
